Directory Contents

Folders

1) CoverImages: Contains the 9 standard test images
2) StegoImages: Contains the stego images which are outputted here by the stego algorithms
3) RandomImages: A collection of about 468 random images used for testing
4) RandomImageTesting: Contains python files for testing on random images.

                       Execution:
                       1) python hamming\ test.py to test for (5,3) Hamming Code
                       2) python hamming_pvd\ test.py to test for Hamming PVD algorithm
                          Note: 2 sets of range intervals are used for testing as mentioned in the paper
                                You can choose the range interval by uncommenting that particular range interval

5) Hamming (5,3): Contains a single file Hamming.py

                  Execution:
                  1) python hamming.py <std_image_name>
                     Eg: python hamming.py barbara

                  The execution shows the step-by-step process. Press the 'Enter' key whenever you want to continue execution

6) Hamming PVD:   Contains the code for executing the Hammming PVD algorithm
                  The main file to execute is HammingPVD.py. The others are just helper files

                  Execution:
                  1) python HammingPVD.py <std_image_name>
                     Eg: python HammingPVD.py lena

                     Note: 2 sets of range intervals are used for testing as mentioned in the paper
                           You can choose the range interval by uncommenting that particular range interval


Files
1) Random Image Testing Results: A PDF file showing the results of random images testing
2) Standard Image Testing Results: A PDF file showing the results of standard images testing
3) input.txt: A text file contain the secret message to be hidden in the cover images
4) output.txt: A text file generated after successful decoding of the message from the stego image
5) Hamming PVD Paper: A PDF file of the Hamming PVD paper
