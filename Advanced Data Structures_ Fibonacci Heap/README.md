# Implementing Fibonacci Heap in C++
## Course Code: CO360
## Advanced Data Structures Assignment

### About
A Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees. 
It has a better amortized running time than many other priority queue data structures including the binary heap and binomial heap.

The heap implementation follows the pseudo-code given in the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS
